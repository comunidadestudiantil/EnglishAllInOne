"My house":`I live in a small house with two bedrooms. My parents sleep in one room, and my sister and I share the other. We have a kitchen where my mom and dad cook dinner every night, and a living room where we watch television together.
    
Our house also has a big bathroom and lots of closets for storage. In the basement, my dad has a workshop where he makes wood furniture. Although we don't have a second floor, we do have a garage.

Outside, our big backyard has a maple tree, a swimming pool, and a vegetable garden. We really like our house.

 "Summer vacation":`Summer vacation is awesome! No more school, just sun, fun, and endless days. 
 
 It's time for swimming, playing in the park, and maybe even a trip with family. Ice cream, barbecues, and long evenings make it the best season. 
 
Whether it's a beach day or just chilling at home, summer vacation is all about smiles and good times!`,
