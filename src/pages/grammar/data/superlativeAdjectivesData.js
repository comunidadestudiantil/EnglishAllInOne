    title:'Use of Comparative Adjectives',
    description:`
We use comparative adjectives when talking about 2 things (not 3 or 10 or 1,000,000 things, only 2 things).
Often, the comparative adjective is followed by *"than"*.

*Look at these examples:*

John is 1m80. He is tall. But Chris is 1m85. He is taller than John.

America is big. But Russia is bigger.

I want to have a more powerful computer.

Is French more difficult than English?

    description:`
A superlative adjective expresses the extreme or highest degree of a quality. We use a superlative adjective to describe the extreme quality of one thing in a group of things.

We can use superlative adjectives when talking about three or more things (not two things).
Formation of Superlative Adjectives

As with comparative adjectives, there are two ways to form a superlative adjective:

Short adjectives: add *"-est"*	
Long adjectives: use *"most"*

Short adjective => Rule add –est	
*Old => the oldest*  

Variation: if the adjective ends in –e, just add –st.	

*Late => the latest*

Variation: if the adjective ends in consonant-vowel-consonant, double the last consonant.

Big => the Bigg*est* 

Variation: if the adjective ends in –y, change the y to i.

Happy => the happi*est*


*Long adjective*

2- syllable adjectives not ending in –y. 
Rule: use “most” 

Modern => the most modern 
Expensive => the most expensive 

Exception: The following adjectives have irregular forms:

Good => the best
Bad => the worst	
Far => the farthest/furthest

*Use of Superlative Adjectives*

We use a superlative adjective to describe one thing in a group of three or more things. Look at these examples:
Canada, China and Russia are big countries. But Russia is the biggest.
Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world.
