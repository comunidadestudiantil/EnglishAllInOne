Possessive pronouns are used to avoid repeating information that is already clear. We use a possessive pronoun instead of a noun phrase.

*Examples:*

I didn't have a car so John lent *me* his car.

I didn't have a car so John lent *me* his.

This is Brad's car. *Our* car is over there.

This is Brad's car. *Ours* is over there.

Whose car is this? Is it *your* car?

Whose car is this? Is it *yours*?
