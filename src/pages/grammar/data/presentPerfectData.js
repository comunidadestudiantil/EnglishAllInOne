We often use the present perfect tense to talk about experience from the past. We are not interested in when you did something. We only want to know if you did it:

Opposite of the present.

Connection with present: the present is the opposite of the past. Americans do not use the present perfect tense so much as British speakers. Americans often use the past tense instead. An American might say "Did you have lunch?” where a British person would say "Have you had lunch?"

*How to make the present perfect?*

Subject + have/has + verb in the past participle form + . . .
