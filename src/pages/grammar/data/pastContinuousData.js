        description:`
The past continuous tense is an important tense in English. We use it to say what we were in the middle of doing at a particular moment in the past.

*How do we make the Past Continuous Tense?*

*The structure of the past continuous tense is:*

Subject + auxiliary (be in past) + main verb + Ing +complement

For negative sentences in the past continuous tense, we insert *not* between the *auxiliary verb* and *main verb*. For *question sentences*, we exchange *the subject and auxiliary verb*. Look at these example sentences with the past continuous tense:

    {first:"Affirmative", second:"Negative", third:'Question'},
    {first:"I *was* sleep*ing*", second:"I *was not*", third:"*Was* I sleeping?"},
    {first:"You *were* sleep*ing*", second:"You *were not*", third:"*Were* you sleeping?"},
    {first:"We *were* sleep*ing*", second:"We *were not*", third:"*Were* we sleeping?"},
    {first:"They *were* sleep*ing*", second:"They *were not*", third:"*Were* they sleeping?"},
    {first:"He *was* sleep*ing*", second:"He *was not*", third:"*Was* he sleeping?"},
    {first:"She *was* sleep*ing*", second:"She *was not*", third:"*Was* she sleeping?"},

    title:'How do we use the Past Continuous Tense?',
    description:`
The past continuous tense expresses action *at a particular moment in the past.* The action started before that moment but has not finished at that moment. 

For example, yesterday I watched a film on TV. The film started at 7pm and finished at 9pm.
