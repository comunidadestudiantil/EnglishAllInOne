        description:`
Adjective (noun): a part-of-speech that modifies or describes a noun or a pronoun
An adjective is one of the eight parts of speech.

An adjective is a word that tells us more about a noun. It "describes" or "modifies" a noun (The big dog was hungry). In these examples, the adjective is in bold and the noun that it modifies is in italics.

*An adjective often comes BEFORE a noun:*

A green car
A dark sky	
An interesting story

*And sometimes an adjective comes AFTER a verb:*

My car is green.
The sky became dark.

*But adjectives can also modify pronouns (She is beautiful). Look at these examples:*

They were empty.	
I thought it seemed strange.

    title:'Comparative Adjectives',
    description:`
When we talk about two things, we can "compare" them. We can see if they are the same or different. Perhaps they are the same in some ways and different in other ways. We can use comparative adjectives to describe the differences.

Formation of Comparative Adjectives

*There are two ways to make or to "form" a comparative adjective:*

Short adjectives: add *"-er"*	
Long adjectives: use *"more"*

*Short adjectives: add -er*

syllable adjectives  *old, fast*
syllable adjectives ending in -y  *happy, easy*	
RULE: add "-er"	*Old => older*

Variation: if the adjective ends in –e, just add –r	 => *Late = later* 

Variation: if the adjective ends in consonant-vowel-consonant. Double the last consonant.

*Big => bigger* 

Variation: if the adjective ends in –y, change the y to i. 

*Happy => happier*

Long adjective: use “more”

Modern => more modern 
Expensive => more expensive 

*Exception:* The following adjectives have irregular forms:

Good => better
Well => better	Bad  worse
Far  => farther/further
