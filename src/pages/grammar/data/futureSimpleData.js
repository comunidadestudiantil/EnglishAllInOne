The simple future tense is often called will, because we make the simple future tense with the modal auxiliary will.

*Structure* 
Subject + will + main verb + complement

For negative sentences in the simple future tense, we insert not between the auxiliary verb and main verb. For question sentences, we exchange the subject and auxiliary verb. Look at these example sentences with the simple future tense: 

*Will*
