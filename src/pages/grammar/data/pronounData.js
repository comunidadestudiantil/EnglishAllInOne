Personal pronouns are words that we use to replace or substitute for nouns in order to avoid repetition. They are an essential part of language and help make communication more concise. Personal pronouns can be categorized into different forms based on their function in a sentence. Here are the main types of personal pronouns:

*The first person singular pronoun* refers to the speaker or the writer. In English, there is one first person singular pronoun:

Subject = *I*	Object = *me*
 
• Used when the speaker or writer refers to themselves.

Example: *I* am going to the store.

In this sentence, *"I"* is the first person singular pronoun, indicating that the speaker (the person making the statement) is going to the store.

*The first person plural pronouns* refer to a group of people that includes the speaker or writer. In English, there are two first person plural pronouns:

Subject = *We*	 Object = *Us*

*We*: Used when the speaker, along with one or more other people, is included in the group.

*Example:* We are going to the store.

In this sentence, *"We"* is the first person plural pronoun, indicating that the speaker and others are going to the store.

*Us*: This is the object form of "we" and is used when the group of people is the object of a verb or preposition.

*Example:* The teacher gave the assignment to *us*.

Here, *"us"* is the first person plural pronoun, functioning as the object of the preposition "to."

These pronouns are important for expressing collective actions or experiences involving the speaker and others.
