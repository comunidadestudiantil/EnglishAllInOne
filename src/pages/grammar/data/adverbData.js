        title:'What is an Adverb?',
        description:`
*Adverb* (noun): a word that modifies a verb, an adjective or another adverb, expressing manner, place, time or degree; a word that can modify a phrase, clause or sentence.

An adverb is a word that tells us more about a verb. It "qualifies" or "modifies" a verb (The man ran quickly). In the following examples, the adverb is in bold and the verb that it modifies is in italics.

• John speaks loudly. (How does John speak?)
• Afterwards she smoked a cigarette. (When did she smoke?)
• Mary lives locally. (Where does Mary live?)

But adverbs can also modify adjectives (Tara is really beautiful), or even other adverbs (It works very well). Look at these examples:

*Modify an adjective:*

- He is really handsome. 
(How handsome is he?)

- That was extremely kind of you.

- Modify another adverb:

- She drives incredibly slowly. (How slowly does she drive?)

- He drives extremely fast.
