Reported Speech also called Indirect Speech or indirect discourse, is a means of expressing the content of statements, questions or other utterances, without quoting them explicitly as is done in direct speech. It is used to communicate what someone else said, think or believe but without using the exact words. A few changes are necessary; often a pronoun has to be changed and the verb is usually moved back a tense, where possible. 

For example, He said "I'm coming" is direct speech, whereas He said he was coming is indirect speech.

Reported speech is usually used to talk about the past, so we normally change the tense of the words spoken. We use reporting verbs like say, tell, ask, and we may use the word that to introduce the reported words. Reported speech doesn’t use quotation marks to enclose what the person said.

*For example:*

*Direct speech:*

I’m going to the English course¡±, he said.

*Reported speech:*
- He said that he was going to the English course.

When reporting questions, it is especially important to pay attention to sentence order. When reporting yes/ no questions connect the reported question using if. When reporting questions using question words (why, where, when, etc.) use the question word.

He asked, do you want to come with me to Ireland?

- He asked me if I wanted to come with him to Ireland.
Peter asked, where did you go last summer?

- Dave asked me where I had gone the previous summer.

Normally, the tense in reported speech is one tense back in time from the tense in direct speech:
She said, "I am tired." = She said that she was tired.
