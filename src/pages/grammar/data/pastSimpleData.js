Subject + main verb in past + complement

*The structure for negative sentences in the simple past tense is:*

Subject + auxiliary (did) + not + main verb + complement

*The structure for question sentences in the simple past tense is:*

Auxiliary (did) + subject + main verb + complement

The auxiliary verb *did* is not conjugated. It is the same for all persons (*I did, you did, he did etc*). And the base form and past form do not change. Look at these examples with the main verbs pay:

*Exception!* The verb to be is different. We conjugate the verb to be (*I was, you were, he/she/it was, we were, they were*); and we do not use an auxiliary for negative and question sentences. To make a question, we exchange the subject and verb. Look at these examples:

    title:'How do we use the Simple Past Tense?',
    description:`
We use the simple past tense to talk about an action or a situation¡ªan event¡ªin the past. The event can be short or long.

*1. Something that happened in the past.*

I went to the party last night.
I didn't go to work yesterday.
Did you go to the party?
I was at work yesterday.

*2. Conditional sentences - type II*

If I had a lot of money, I would buy an iPhone.

*3. Series of completed actions in the past.*

I got up, had breakfast and then went to school.

*Notice* that it does not matter how long ago the event is: it can be a few minutes or seconds in the past, or millions of years in the past. Also, it does not matter how long the event is. It can be a few milliseconds (car explosion) or millions of years (Jurassic period). We use the simple past tense when:

• The event is completely finished.
• We say (or understand) the time and/or place of the event

*In general*, if we say *the time or place of the event*, we must use *the simple past tense*; we *cannot* use *the present perfect*. The event is in the past.
