Modal verbs are a kind of auxiliary verb. They facilitate the main verb for suggesting potential, expectation, permission, ability, possibility, and obligation.

When used with the main verb, modal verbs do not end with -s for the third-person singular.  Modal auxiliary verbs never change form, but they have a different form for past tense.

*The modal auxiliaries include.*

*Present Tense*

Will
Can
Must (have to)
May
Should (ought to) (had better)

*Past Tense*

Would (used to)
Could
(Had to)
Might
Should (ought to)

NB: The words in parentheses ( ) are semi-modals. They have the same meaning, but they are different grammatically.

*Will - Would*
*Will* indicates a (willingness) to do something in the future. The negative form of will-will not (wont) indicates an unwillingness (refusal, reluctance) to do something.

*Example:*

*Can & could* also indicate possibility.
