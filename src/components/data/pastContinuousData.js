        description:`
The past continuous tense is an important tense in English. We use it to say what we were in the middle of doing at a particular moment in the past.

*How do we make the Past Continuous Tense?*

*The structure of the past continuous tense is:*

Subject + auxiliary (be in past) + main verb + Ing +complement

For negative sentences in the past continuous tense, we insert *not* between the *auxiliary verb* and *main verb*. For *question sentences*, we exchange *the subject and auxiliary verb*. Look at these example sentences with the past continuous tense:

*Affirmative*

I *was* sleep*ing*.
You *were* sleep*ing*.
We *were* sleep*ing*.
They *were* sleep*ing*.
He *was* sleep*ing*.
She *was* sleep*ing*.
It *was* sleep*ing*.

*Negative*

I *was not / wasn't* sleeping.
You *were not / weren't* sleeping.
We *were not / weren't* sleeping.
They *were not / weren't* sleeping.
He *was not / wasn't*  sleeping.
She *was not / wasn't* sleeping.
It *was not / wasn't*  sleeping.

*Question*

*Was* I sleeping?
*Were* you sleeping?
*Were* we sleeping?
*Were* they sleeping?
*Was* he sleeping?
*Was* she sleeping?
*Was* it sleeping?

    title:'How do we use the Past Continuous Tense?',
    description:`
The past continuous tense expresses action *at a particular moment in the past.* The action started before that moment but has not finished at that moment. 

For example, yesterday I watched a film on TV. The film started at 7pm and finished at 9pm.
