The structure of the present continuous tense is: 

*Subject + auxiliary (be) + main verb + Ing + complement*

Look at these examples:

    description:`*“Note”* use *the present continuous tense* to talk about the *future* if we add a *future word!* We must add (or understand from the context) a future word. "Future words" include, for example, *tomorrow, next year, in June, at Christmas etc*. We only use the present continuous tense to talk about the future when we have planned to do something before we speak. We have already made a decision and a plan before speaking.

*How do we spell the Present Continuous Tense?*

Just add *–ing* to the base verb.

Work	==>	Work*ing*
Play	==>	Play*ing*
See	==>	See*ing*
Be	 ==>	Be*ing*

*Exception*

*Note* that this exception does not apply when the last syllable of the base verb is not stressed.

Example: *open ==> opening*

If the base verb ends in *consonant + stressed vowel + consonant*:  *double the last letter.*

Stop ==> Stop*ping*
Run	==>	Run*ning*
Begin ==> Begin*ning*

*Exception 2  ==> If the base verb ends in ie, change the ie to y:*

Lie	==> l*ying*
Die	==> d*ying*

*Exception 3  ==>   If the base verb ends in vowel + consonant + e, omit the e:*

Come ==> Com*ing*
Mistake	==>	mistak*ing*
