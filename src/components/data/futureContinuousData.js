*How do we make the Future Continuous Tense?*

The structure of the future continuous tense is:

Subject + auxiliary (will invariable) + auxiliary (be invariable) + main verb + Ing + complement

For negative sentences in the future continuous tense, we insert not between will and be. For question sentences, we exchange the subject and will. Look at these example sentences with the future continuous tense:

*Affirmative*

I will be sleeping.
You will be sleeping.
We will be sleeping.
They will be sleeping.
He will be sleeping.
She will be sleeping.
It will be sleeping.

*Negative*

I will not be sleeping.
You will not be sleeping.
We will not be sleeping.
They will not be sleeping.
He will not be sleeping.
She will not be sleeping.
It will not be sleeping.

*Question*

Will I be sleeping?
Will you be sleeping?
Will we be sleeping?
Will they be sleeping?
Will he be sleeping?
Will she be sleeping?
Will it be sleeping?

        description:`
*We use the Future Continuous to talk about:*

The future continuous tense expresses action at a particular moment in the future. The action will start before that moment but it will not have finished at that moment. For example, tomorrow I will start work at 2pm and stop work at 6pm:

*1. Something that will be in progress at a certain time in the future.*

• I will be sleeping when you arrive.

• We will be playing football tomorrow morning.

• He will be going to the party tonight.
