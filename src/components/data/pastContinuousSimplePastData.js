    description:`
We often use the past continuous tense with the simple past tense. We use the past continuous tense to express a long action. And we use the simple past tense to express a short action that happens in the middle of the long action. We can join the two ideas with when or while.

In the following example, we have two actions:

*I was watching TV at 8pm.*
*You telephoned at 8pm.*

*Short action.*		

We can join these two actions with *when*.

I was watching TV when you telephoned.

*Notice* that *"when you telephoned"* is also a way of defining the time [8pm].
