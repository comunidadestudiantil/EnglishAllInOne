When a verb ends in *-ing*, it may be a present participle or it may be a gerund. It is important to understand that they are not the same.
When we use a verb in *-ing* form more like a verb or an adjective, it is usually a present participle:

•	Anthony is fish*ing*.
•	I have a bor*ing* teacher.

*When we use a verb in -ing form more like a noun, it is usually a gerund:*

•	Fish*ing* is fun.

In this lesson, we look at how we use gerunds, followed by a quiz to check your understanding:

•	Gerund as Subject, Object or Complement
•	Gerund after Preposition
•	Gerund after Certain Verbs
•	Gerund in Passive Sense

Gerunds are sometimes called "verbal nouns". It should be noted that many grammarians do not like to use the term "gerund" because there is sometimes no clear difference between a gerund and a present participle.

Try to think of a gerund as a noun in verb form.

Like nouns, gerunds can be the subject, object or complement of a sentence:

•	Smoking costs a lot of money.
•	I don't like writing.
•	My favorite occupation is reading.

But, like verbs, gerund can also have an object itself. In this case, the whole expression (gerund + object) can be the subject, object or complement of the sentence.

• Smoking cigarettes costs a lot of money.
• I don't like writing letters.
• My favorite occupation is reading detective stories.

Like nouns, we can use gerunds with adjectives (including articles and other determiners): 

*Pointless questioning.*
The making of this film.

*A settling of debts.*
His drinking of alcohol.

When we use a gerund with an article, it does not usually take a direct object:

*A settling of debts (not a settling debts).*

Making this film was expensive.
The making of this film was expensive.

*Do you see the difference in the following two sentences? In one, "reading" is a gerund (noun). In the other, "reading" is a present participle (verb).*

My favorite occupation is reading.
My favorite niece is reading.

        title:'Gerund after Preposition',
        description:`
Here is a good rule. It has no exceptions:

Prepositions are always followed by a noun-phrase.

If we want to use a verb after a preposition, it must be a gerund (which functions as a noun). It is impossible to use an 
infinitive after a preposition. So, for example, we say:

•	I will call you after arriving at the office. Not I will call after to arrive at the office.
•	Please have a drink before leaving.
•	I am looking forward to meeting you.
•	Do you object to working late?
•	Tara always dreams about going on holiday.

*Notice that you could replace all the above gerunds with "real" nouns: *

•	I will call you after my arrival at the office.
•	Please have a drink before your departure.
•	I am looking forward to our lunch.
•	Do you object to this job.

*Tara always dreams about holidays.*

The above rule has no exceptions! So in the following sentences why is to followed by "driving" in #1 and by "drive" in #2?

•	I am used to driving on the left.
•	I used to drive on the left.

        description:`
We sometimes use one verb after another verb. Often the second verb is in the to-infinitive form, for example:

I want to eat. But sometimes the second verb must be in gerund form, for example:

I dislike eating.
